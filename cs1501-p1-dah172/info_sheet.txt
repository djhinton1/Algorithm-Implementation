Additional comments to the grader:

Since I am doing the writing portion of the class among other things, I ran out of time to ensure words were not duplicated in the displayed predictions if the word is in both the user history and the dictionary.

Also, if the displayed predictions don't contain the full 5 words, the remaining (empty) spots in the array will have a null placeholder. 

Also, I accidentally uploaded LL.class not sure if that is going to have any effect on your end.

Thanks!
